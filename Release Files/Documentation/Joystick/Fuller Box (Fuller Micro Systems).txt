JOYSTICK CONTROLLER

The Fuller Box has a socket to allow connection of any commercially available
joystick such as Atari, Commodore, Competition Pro, Diskwasher, etc.

The stick works as an input device on port 127. This means that the value
presented to port 127 will change according to which direction the stick is
being pushed, or if the fire button has been hit.

Please note that no joysticks work in conjunction with any particular keys
without the aid of software. So, to make your own games work with a joystick
you will need to add or change a few program lines.

The binary value of port 127 is normally 11111111 or decimal 255. This
value is changed when you move the joystick. Certain bits of port 127 are
pulled low to binary 0 by the stick. The actions of the bits are as follows:

+--------+----------------------------------------+
|    BIT |   7    6    5    4    3    2    1    0 |
| ACTION | FIRE   -    -    -  RIGHT LEFT DOWN UP |
+--------+----------------------------------------+

So when going up, bit 0 is low and port 127 contains the value (255-1)=254.

Type in the following line of program.

    10 PRINT IN 127: POKE 23692,0: GO TO 10

Move the stick around and see how the value changes. (The POKE makes the
screen scroll automatically).

The values obtained are:

    UP   = 254    RIGHT      = 247    DOWN & RIGHT = 245
    DOWN = 253    FIRE       = 127    UP & LEFT    = 250
    LEFT = 251    UP & RIGHT = 246    DOWN & LEFT  = 249

Note that moving in any direction and firing will simply give a number 127,
less than the value for that direction.

 To use the joystick in your own games, simply replace a BASIC statement
such as:

       IF INKEY$="5" THEN –––––––––– (move to the left)
with:  IF IN 127=251 THEN –––––––––– (as before)
or:    IF INKEY$="F" THEN –––––––––– FIRE –––––––––
with:  IF IN 127=127 THEN –––––––––– FIRE –––––––––

All Imagine Software games will work automatically with the joystick controller.
However, if any of your commercial software won’t work please contact the
manufacturers, they will be glad to offer advice and assistance.
