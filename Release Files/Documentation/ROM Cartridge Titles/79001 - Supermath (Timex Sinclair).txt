SUPERMATH
© Timex 1982

SUPERMATH, with its five levels of difficulty, is a useful instruction aid for
anyone who wishes to improve their skill in the four basic arithmetic functions;
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division. In each session, you will be
given ten problems to solve and at the end of the session, a grade will be
displayed, reflecting your achievement and allowing you to keep track of your
progress. Problems are randomly generated, such that every session produces
new tests of your skill, at the level of difficulty you have chosen.

To play, insert the software cartridge into the Timex Command Cartridgeù Player
(see instruction booklet for details) and begin. You will be asked to select a
number, 1 through 4, denoting what type of problems you wish to practice:
(1) Addition, (2) Subtraction, (3) Multiplication, or (4) Division. Once you have
made the selection, and the ENTER key has been pressed, you will be asked to
choose a difficulty level of 1 through 5 (Level 1 generates very simple problems,
with the degree of difficulty increasing, until Level 5, where the problems
become quite complex). It should now be noted that Level 5 Division, or, for that
matter, any Division, will always require an answer in whole numbers only. You
need not be concerned about the number of decimal positions, or the like. It will
always be a whole-number answer.

When the first problem appears on the screen, you will be asked to enter your
answer. If your answer is correct, your computer will indicate that it is correct,
and the next problem will appear. If, at any time, you answer incorrectly, your
computer will indicate the correct answer, give you time to recognize it, and then
move onto the next problem.

At the end of ten problems, your Grade will be displayed, and you will then be
asked if you wish to have another session. Answer Y (for Yes), or N (for No), and
play will continue accordingly. The game may be interrupted, at any time, by
depressing the BREAK key. Play may be restarted by pressing RUN.
