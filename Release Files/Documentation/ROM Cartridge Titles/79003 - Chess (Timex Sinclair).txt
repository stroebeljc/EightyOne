CHESS is a machine code program which automatically starts executing once it
is loaded.


CHESS:

To play, insert the software cartridge into the Timex Command Cartridge Player
(see instruction booklet for details) and begin. Before the game can start you will
be asked a few questions. All replies should be terminated by the ENTER key
and the usual BASIC editing facilities apply. The program looks at only the first
letter of any reply so, for example, YES can be abbreviated to Y.

The first question asks if you want to play a game. A reply of NO allows you to
set up any board position before starting the game. For the moment, we will
assume you have given the more usual reply of YES. You will then be asked for
your choice of color, to which you should, of course, reply WHITE or BLACK.
Finally you may select the level of ability (1 to 6) of your computer. Level 1
replies to your move in about 5 seconds, level 2 takes about 35 seconds and
level 3 several minutes. Levels 4, 5 and 6 are only suitable to very extended
games. These times are representative and in practice a reply to check is
usually rapid while a reply to a complex position could take considerably longer.

The game has now started, a chessboard is displayed and your move is
requested. Although it is quite possible to play using only the displayed board,
you will be at a disadvantage unless you follow the game on a normal board. It is
easy and convenient to check that the position on the displayed board and the
real board correspond, and that you and the computer are playing the same
game. Each piece is represented by a letter: K for king, Q for queen, A for
rook, B for bishop, N for knight and I for pawn. The color of the piece is the
color of the displayed letter. The board is always presented with the player at
the bottom.

Moving is performed by entering the coordinates of the square from which you
are moving, followed by a space, then the coordinates of the square to which
you wish to move.

The coordinates are those of the algebraic system of chess notation (used by
most modern chess books) where, from White’s side, the columns are
designated A to H from left to right, and the rows are numbered 1 to
8 from White's side to Black's. If White's first move is to advance his king's pawn
two squares, then E2 E4 should be entered. On the other hand, if Black is to
move his king's pawn two squares forward, then E7 E5 should be entered. If you
are unfamiliar with this notation you will find it easier to play white for the first
few games.

Invalid moves are not allowed. Castling is done by entering the king's move and
will be displayed as 0-0 (King's side) or 0-0-0 (Queen's side) if performed by the
computer. En passant is recognized and will be displayed as PXPEP by the
computer. At the normal termination of a game by checkmate (either way), the
computer will wait for you to hit ENTER before restarting the program.

If you reply NO when you are asked if you want to play a game, you will then be
asked if you want to set up the board. Another reply of NO will return you to
BASIC and clear the program. A reply of YES will display the board with an "="
sign in one corner denoting the active square. Typing 5 or 8 will move the "=". If
you wish to insert or alter the contents of the active square, enter K, Q, R, B,
N or P for a king, queen, rook, bishop, knight or pawn respectively. You will
then be asked for the color of the piece and whether or not it has moved. If a
piece has moved away from and back to its original position then it is counted as
being moved. The "=" sign will then continue to the next square. When you have
finished setting up the board, exit by typing X.

The program will ask for confirmation of the board and then request the new
parameters for the game - player's color, the computer's ability and the current
move - before playing the game.

As alternative means to enter the board setup routine is to enter RESIGN at
your move and answer NO to "do you want to play another game". In this case
the board will be displayed for setting-up in the same position as it was on
resignation. By this means it is even possible to change sides during a game or
to alter the computer's ability.
