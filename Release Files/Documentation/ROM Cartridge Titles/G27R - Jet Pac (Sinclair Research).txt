The 'Acme Interstellar Transport Company' is delivering spaceship kits to various
planets in the solar system throughout the Galaxy; and as chief test pilot, all
you have to do is assemble the Rockets, and thrust on to your next destination.

As you don't often get the chance of a free trip across the Galaxy, this is a great
opportunity to get rich! Stop off on several planets on your journey, collect the
odd sack of precious gems, elements or gold, and take them back with you.

Sounds simple doesn't it!

But before you make yourself the richest person in the whole Universe, remember to
refuel your Spaceship - with 6 fuel pods - every time you land on a planet. Any
other goodies you collect are yours to keep. Upon landing, you will find yourself
equipped with the very latest Hydrovac Jet Pac, which can automatically air lift
almost any rocket stage, fuel pod or valuables that you care to land upon, and
release them over the rocket ship base. Don't forget your mega-powerful, Quad
Photon Laser Phasers can blast any nasty, mean aliens who might object to your
visit.
