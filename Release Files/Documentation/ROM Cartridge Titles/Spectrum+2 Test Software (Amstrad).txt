Spectrum +2 Test Software

The Spectrum +2 test software comes on a rom board. This should be plugged into
the Expansion 1/O slot of the +2. The +2 should also have a loopback cable plugged
into the KEYPAD and RS232 sockets, two joysticks plugged in, and monitor, TV and
audio amp connected.

Turn the machine on. One of two things will happen.

1) A test card with some text will appear. Follow the instructions on the screen.
2) No text or testcard. In this case, note the colour of the edge of the screen.
   It will either be a steady colour or flashing regularly with a predominant
   colour. Consult the table below to find out which RAM chip has (probably) failed.

      Colour     STEADY    FLASHING

      BLACK      IC 17     IC 32
      BLUE       IC 18     IC 31
      RED        Ic 19     IC 30
      MAGENTA    IC 20     IC 29
      GREEN      IC 21     IC 28
      CYAN       IC 22     IC 27
      YELLOW     IC 23     IC 26
      WHITE      IC 24     IC 25

If you follow the instructions on screen from the first occurence, then everything
should be self-explanatory. The RAM test, if it finds a fault, will give two
numbers. The first is the address at which the fault was found, and the second is
the bank of memory which contained the address. If the address is zero, then it is
probably not a RAM fault, but a paging hardware problem. Note that there is no way
to fail the keyboard test - if a key won't respond then you can progress no
further.

The cassette test comes in two parts. The first cassette test is similar to the
ULA sound test, and is the last test in the ROM program. The tone it asks you to
hear is much quieter than the other noises. The second cassette test comes on a
tape and is used when the BASIC is running. Turn on the Spectrum, wait for the
menu to appear and then press ENTER. Then start the test cassette. After a short
while, the words PROGRAM: Loading... should appear, and shortly afterwards some
instructions will appear on the screen. Follow these to test the cassette unit.
