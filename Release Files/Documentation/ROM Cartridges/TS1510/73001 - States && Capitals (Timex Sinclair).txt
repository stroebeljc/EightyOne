STATES AND CAPITALS

Loading time: 2 minutes 45 seconds

An entertaining educational program to help you learn the 50 states and their capitals. The
TS2000 draws you a map of the United States, shows you where each state is and locates the
capital cities. STATES AND CAPITALS teaches you geography. And, because all names
must be spelled correctly, you will be sharpening your spelling skills. You can have the
TS2000 name the states and ask you for their capitals, or give you the capitals and ask you to
supply the states - or a combination of the two. Also, "quiz the computer" by entering one and
asking the computer to supply the other, thereby allowing the program to serve as a handy
reference tool.

TIMEX COMMAND CARTRIDGE INSTRUCTIONS
If you have the cartridge version of this software program, please follow the steps listed
below:

1. Turn off your TS2000.
2. Lift cartridge door open.
3. Insert command cartridge with label side up.
4. Close cartridge door.
5. Turn on your TS2000.
6. Program will now begin execution.

If Step 5 does not occur, start over with Step 1 ... and reset cartridge once again.

ALWAYS TURN OFF YOUR TS2000 BEFORE INSERTING OR REMOVING CARTRIDGE. You may bypass tape load
instructions below.

TO LOAD: Press LOAD "loader" start your tape and press ENTER. The program will load in
2 minutes, 45 seconds. Stop the tape when the TS2000 tells you it is "selecting questions".
Throughout the program, you will be shown instructions on the screen to guide you in its use.
Always remember to press ENTER after typing anything with the flashing L cursor showing
at the bottom of the screen.

TO PLAY: After the computer has selected its questions, you'll be asked to "pick your topic."
You may choose from the following four option -

1. CAPITALS: Press 1. You are given the names of states, and asked to supply their capitals.

NOTE: You have two chances at each question before the computer tells you the answer. All
names must be spelled correctly (including capital letters where appropriate), or the computer
will treat your answer as an incorrect one. If you use the DELETE key to change an answer
before pressing ENTER, and you accidentally erase a quotation mark, type in a new one. Both
your answer and the L cursor must be completely within the quotes. Otherwise, when you
press ENTER, you'll see a question mark next to the L.

You may exit any section by typing an X in response to a question. Then press S to select
another topic, or E to quit the program entirely.

2. STATES: Press 2. You are given the names of capitals, and asked to type in their states.

3. MIXED CAPITALS AND STATES: Press 3. In this section you are given either the state
or the capital, and asked to supply the other.

4. ENTER STATES OR CAPITALS: Press 4. Type either the name of a state or a capital,
and the TS2000 replies with both and shows you their locations on the map.

There are 50 questions in each quiz. At the end, you are told how many you have answered
correctly. Press S to select another topic, or E to quit the program.

Good luck!

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
(See Chapter 4 of your instruction manual for detailed instructions.)

1. First listen to the tape so you will be familiar with its distinct sections. The tape has a
period of silence at the beginning, followed by a high-pitched, screechy noise. This is the
computer program. The program is recorded twice on the cassette in case one does not load.

2. Set the volume control on the cassette deck to about 3/4 of the maximum. If you have
tone controls, set the bass to minimum and treble to maximum. If you have just one tone
control, set it to HIGH or MAXIMUM.

3. Rewind the tape to the beginning. Connect the EAR jack on the computer to the EAR
jack on the cassette deck recorder. Make sure the plugs are clean and securely in place.

4. To instruct the computer to accept the program you must press the LOAD command and
type the name of the program in quotation marks. See the instructions or cassette for the
correct loading name.

5. Start the cassette deck, allow a few seconds for it to get up to speed, then press ENTER
during the silence before the program begins.

6. The border of the TV screen will alternate between pale blue (cyan) and red, during the
time the computer is searching for the program on the tape.

7. When the program has been found, the screen border will show a pattern of lines in the
same shades of blue and red, and shortly the name of the program will appear on the screen.

8. Next, as the program itself is being loaded into the computer, the border pattern will
become thinner, faster moving yellow and dark blue lines.

9. When the computer has finished loading the program, one of two things will happen:

  1. Most commercial programs will begin running automatically, usually with a "title
     screen" or instructions to the user. (A title screen may tell you that the tape is still
     loading, if not, you should stop the tape immediately at this point so as to be in the
     proper position to load the next program if you wish.) or

  2. The screen will be blank, except for a 0 OK, 0:1 in the lower left hand corner. This is a
     report code and means that the computer has successfully loaded the program.
     Stop the tape immediately. To execute the program, you press RUN and ENTER. This
     will start the program.

SOME SUGGESTIONS
1. The volume at which the program is loaded is very important. Usually 3/4 maximum
volume works best, but recorders vary and may require experimentation with the volume
setting. If you have a technical background you can check the output level of your recorder's
EAR/SPKR jack. It must be at least 4-volts peak-to-peak, although 5 to 6-volts peak-to-peak
is best.

2. Clean and demagnetize the heads of the tape recorder. Your ears may not pick up the
signal fluctuations due to magnetic flux on the tape heads, but the computer has a much more
sensitive "ear."

3. The computer is very susceptible to outside interference. Working on a metal table or
near electrical appliances should be avoided.

4. Occasionally, once a program has loaded, the video display will show instability. This
can be corrected by adjusting the vertical hold on the television.
