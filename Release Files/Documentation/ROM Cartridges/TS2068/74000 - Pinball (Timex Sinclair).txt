Flashing lights, Changing colors, electronic sounds and fast action are just part
of the realism involved in playing this challenging pinball adaptation. Catapult
your Spinning ball out onto the electronic playing held. The excitement
heightens as your ball bounces off the flashing bumpers and into the scoring
pockets, racking up points. Use your dual directional flippers to guide your ball
through the blockade into the “fruit machine,” and increase your score by
playing the slots.
