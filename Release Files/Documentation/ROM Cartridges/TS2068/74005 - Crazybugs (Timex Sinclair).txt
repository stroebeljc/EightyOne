Loading time: 1 minute, 10 seconds

Load name must be typed in lower case letters.

Bugs, bugs and super-bugs are out to get you as you race through their subterranean
maze, trying to steal beetle eggs and stash them under lock and key.

The object of the game is to steal as many beetle eggs as you can and place them
under locks, without getting caught by the bugs and super bugs.

You may bypass tape load instructions below.

TO LOAD: Press LOAD "bugs", start the cassette player and press enter. The program
loads in 1 minute 10 seconds. Stop the tape when the CRAZYBUGS title screen
appears, asking you to select a level of difficulty.

TO PLAY: Select a level of difficulty (1 being the least difficult and 3 being the
most difficult), or wait to be shown a short demonstration of the game.

After selecting the difficulty level, you are in the lower left-hand corner of the
bugs' subterranean maze. To move your man, use either the joystick feature or the
following keys:
  Q = move up
  Z = move down
  I = move left
  P = move right

JOYSTICK FEATURE - 1 PLAYER
This program optionally allows the use of a joystick to control its actions. With
the joystick in slot 1 the following actions replace their keyboard counterparts:
  Stick up = move man up
  Stick down = move man down
  Stick left = move man left
  Stick right = move man right

THIS PROGRAM REQUIFRES THE JOYSTICK TO BE IN THE PLAYER 1 SLOT.

Move your man through the maze, stealing the beetle eggs that appear randomly
throughout the maze. Once you have a beetle egg, a lock appears (a flashing red and
white box). Place the beetle egg in the box and head off in search of the next
beetle egg.

Once you've collected four beetle eggs an exit from the maze appears (flashing
white door), take it and go into the next subterranean passage. As you advance
through the different stages of CRAZYBUG, watch out for the Super Bugs! Al first
there's only one, but they team up on you later.

SCORING
Score 50 points for every beetle egg you steal, and 50 points for every egg you
secure under lock and key. For every subterranean passage you exit, you are awarded
100 points.

BONUS
You will receive your first extra man al 1,100 points, after that you will receive
an extra man for every 2,200 points you score.

Good luck, and don't get bugged!

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
(See Chapter 4 of your instruction manual for detailed instructions.)

1. First listen to the tape so you will be familiar with its distinct sections. The
tape has a period of silence at the beginning, followed by a high-pitched, screechy
noise. This is the computer program. The program is recorded twice on the cassette
in case one does not load.

2. Set the volume control on the cassette deck to about 3/4 of the maximum. If you
have tone controls, set the bass to minimum and treble to maximum. If you have just
one tone control, set it to HIGH or MAXIMUM.

3. Rewind the tape to the beginning. Connect the EAR jack on the computer to the
EAR jack on the cassette deck recorder. Make sure the plugs are clean and securely
in place.

4. To instruct the computer to accept the program you must press the LOAD command
and type the name of the program in quotation marks. See the instructions or
cassette for the correct loading name.

5. Start the cassette deck, allow a few seconds for it to get up to speed, then
press ENTER during the silence before the program begins.

6. The border of the TV screen will alternate between pale blue (cyan) and red,
during the time the computer is searching for the program on the tape.

7. When the program has been found, the screen border will show a pattern of lines
in the same shades of blue and red, and shortly the name of the program will appear
on the screen.

8. Next, as the program itself is being loaded into the computer, the border
pattern will become thinner, faster moving yellow and dark blue lines.

9. When the computer has finished loading the program, one of two things will
happen:

  1. Most commercial programs will begin running automatically, usually with a
  "title screen" or instructions to the user. (A title screen may tell you that the
  tape is still loading, if not, you should stop the tape immediately at this point
  so as to be in the proper position to load the next program if you wish.) or

  2. The screen will be blank, except for a 0 OK, 0:1 in the lower left hand corner.
  This is a report code and means that the computer has successfully loaded the
  program.
  Stop the tape immediately. To execute the program, you press RUN and ENTER. This
  will start the program.

SOME SUGGESTIONS
1. The volume at which the program is loaded is very important. Usually 3/4 maximum
volume works best, but recorders vary and may require experimentation with the
volume setting. If you have a technical background you can check the output level
of your recorder's EAR/SPKR jack. It must be at least 4-volts peak-to-peak,
although 5 to 6-volts peak-to-peak is best.

2. Clean and demagnetize the heads of the tape recorder. Your ears may not pick up
the signal fluctuations due to magnetic flux on the tape heads, but the computer
has a much more sensitive "ear."

3. The computer is very susceptible to outside interference. Working on a metal
table or near electrical appliances should be avoided.

4. Occasionally, once a program has loaded, the video display will show
instability. This can be corrected by adjusting the vertical hold on the television.
