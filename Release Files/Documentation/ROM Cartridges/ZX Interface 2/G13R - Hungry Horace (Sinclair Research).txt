G13/R HUNGRY HORCE ROM Cartridge for the ZX Spectrum
Sinclair Research
====================================================

You are Hungry Horace, intent on devouring everything in your path. You can move
Horace along the paths, bridges and tunnels of the park using the Spectrum
keyboard, or joysticks. Each flower in the park that Horace eats scores 10 posts.
But beware of the park guards who are out to catch Horace and throw him out of the
park. If Horace is caught 3 times he will not be allowed back in the park and the
game will end. There are several alarm bells in the park. If Horace can ring one of
the alarms, the guards will panic and Horace can catch them and throw them out of
the park.

Watch for one of the guards dropping his lunch of cherries or strawberries. You
will score 100 points if Horace eats the guards' lunch.

The park is divided into several sections and in each part there is an exit
leading to the next section. Horace does not need to eat all the flowers or reach
the alarm before entering the next section. Each section of the park is harder
than the one before.
