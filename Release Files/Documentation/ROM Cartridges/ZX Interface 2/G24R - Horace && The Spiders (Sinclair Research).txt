============================================================

Horace is engaged in a hunt to rid the Spider mountains of the deadly octopeds
which inhabit them. He sets out with four phials of serum which protect him from
the fatal bites, but when he has used these he must give up the hunt.

His task is in three stages:
  He must climb the hills to reach the mountain.
  He must cross the Spider bridge.
  And finally he must kill the spiders in the cave.

Horace must survive each of these stages in order to pass onto the next. If he
succeeds in killing all the spiders, he returns to the first stage and is faced
with steeper hill and more spiders,

Climbing the Hills

Horace must climb the hills, jumping up to get to the next level, while avoiding
the spiders. The only way that he can avoid the spiders is to jump over them.
Pressing key Q makes Horace jump and running jumps can be produced by pressing key
Q while P is depressed. If Horace misjudges his jumps and falls over he will break
one of his phials of spider serum.


Crossing the Spider bridge

To cross the Spider bridge, Horace must grab hold of a spider thread by pressing
key Q and swing from thread to thread until he reaches the other side. But the
spiders, when they sense that Horace has grabbed a thread, will try to reel him in,
so he must be fast. When he reaches the other side, pressing key Z will make
Horace jump down.


Killing the Spiders

When Horace reaches the cave, he finds 4 full of spiders busily mending a giant
web. Horace can move around the web and make holes in it by stamping, (keys V, B,
N or M), until it gives way.

The spider will try to mend the holes by hanging in the gap. In this vulnerable
position Horace can kill them by stamping on them until they drop into the web
below, but they will not die if there is another hole beneath for them to hang in.
The same keys control Horace's movements around the web, but he only stops when
stamping.

You can pause the game at any time by pressing key S and subsequently continue by
pressing any key along the bottom row. A game can be aborted and a new game
started by pressing keys G and H together.
