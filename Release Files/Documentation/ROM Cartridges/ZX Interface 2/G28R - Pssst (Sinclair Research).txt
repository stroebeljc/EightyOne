Robbie the robot sits in his garden, fetching the old bag of compost to help his
prize Thyrgodian Megga Chrisanthodil grow. Then suddenly the whole garden is
invaded by the most devilish, destructive insects you could imagine. But Robbie is
prepared!

Equipped with three spray cans of the latest insect repellent, smoke and streamers,
Robbie fights to keep the deadly garden pests at bay.

All he has to do is figure out which spray kills each insect outright, as the
wrong spray will only stun them momentarily If Robbie leaves his plant unattended
the insects will swarm all over it, eat the leaves and the plant will wilt and die.


Growing Instructions

Plant the seeds in good soil. Growth can be speeded up by collecting all compost
bags, keeping young shoots free from all garden pests and by looking alter the
leaves, which collect sunlight. Remember, the more leaves the plant has, the faster
it will grow. As the young shoots give off an exotic aroma, the plant is
especially attractive to hoards of Interstellar Space Slugs. Scuttling Leeches and
Menacing Midges. Use of correct repellents will prevent all of these attacks.

Please note: only approximately 20% of all plants will blossom and reveal Robbie's
ultimate dream. Growing time approximately 2 to 5 minutes.
