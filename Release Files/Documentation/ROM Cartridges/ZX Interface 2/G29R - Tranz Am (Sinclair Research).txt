================================================

The year is 3472 and all that remains on Earth are the ruins of a once great
continent, a barren land, a desolate place of sand, rocks and boulders. But life
adapts quickly and brings with it a New Age, a time ruled by cars and trophies, a
land where petrol replaces gold, and esteem is possession of the 8 Great Cups of
Ultimate. Possessed for too long by the 'Deadly Black Turbos', the 8 cups remain
hidden through the land, their strange inscriptions long since forgotten and their
locations reverently protected. Your chance...a Super Blown Red Racer equipped
with advanced technology, and power which far surpasses any Black Turbo.
