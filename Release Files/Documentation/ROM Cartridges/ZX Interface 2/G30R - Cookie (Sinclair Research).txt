Charlie the Chef keeps all the ingredients locked away in the pantry, only letting
them out when he wants to cook them!

Without doubt, this makes them jolly upset!

So as soon as they can, the ingredients dash out of the pantry dragging all sorts
of nasties from the bottom of drawers and cupboards.

Poor old Chartie! He has to daze the ingredients with flour bombs and knock them
into the mixing bowl, because if they go into the dustbins they will be eaten by
the bin monster.

Should any rubbish or nasties get into the cake mix then the 'ingredients needed'
counter will change, and Charlie will have to work faster, if he's going to bake
his cake.
