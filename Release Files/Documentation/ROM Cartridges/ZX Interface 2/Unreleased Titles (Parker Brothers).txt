PANAMA JOE
==========

Here's a story 'bout Panama Joe
The Rap inside is what you need to know


Montezuma's Rap

This is the place where PJ's gone
You wan to walk with him, step right along
Down in the ground buried for an age
Is a pyramid and that's our stage
Let's act!

Way down here's where Montezuma lived
So let's find out how he protected it.
Well, there's fire and flame all over the place
Step in there and you'll singe your face,
It's a pit!

Hey! Dodge that skull - mind that snake
You walk on him and your bones'll ache!
Leap that chasm - climb that rope
If you fall off you'll feel a dope
It's a drop!

Well I think that I've been here before
Only thing is I didn't use that door!
I think that I'll retrace my steps
Grab that key and go onto the next
It's a maze!

Now this here game takes a lot of doing
But Panama Joe just keeps on going
He's got five lives and they could prove
To be just enough to reach the treasure trove
It's a steal!

RETURN OF THE JEDI - DEATH STAR BATTLE
======================================

The Empire is building an awesome and sinister weapon - THE DEATH STAR!
Can you, and the Millenium Falcon, stop them?


Death Star Battle

The objective of your mission is the destruction of the Death Star ... but
reaching this powerful and heavily defended space station will not be easy.

First you must survive the attacks of the Tie Interceptors as they
relentlessly pursue you. When you reach the Death Star you must anticipate the
seemingly random way in which portals in the enemy field open up. These portals 
allow Tie Interceptors access to their base and they provide the Millennium
Falcon with its chance to penetrate the Death Star's defences. You'll need
split second timing if you're to make it through.

Once you penetrate the enemy shield you'll still have to contend with the heat
seeking Death Ray. Blast the Death Star with your Pulse Laser until you have
cleared a route to the energy core - hit that and the terrible construction
will be engulfed in a fearsome explosion sending hundreds of blazing fireballs
hurtling into space. You'll need all your piloting skills to avoid being hit
by one and meeting the same fate as the Death Star.

LOADING
To load Death Star Battle type LOAD "" and press ENTER
The start the tape (The Spectrum manual gives step-by-step loading instructions)

PLAYING
When Death Star Battle has finished loading you will be offered a Joystick
select screen:
1  selects Kempston
2  selects Protek
3  selects ZX Interface 2
4  allows use defined keys

The ZX Interface 2 joystick is the right-hand one and uses the control keys:
6 to move left, 7 to move right, 8 to move down, 9 to move up and 0 to fire.
(Any joystick with a 9-way D plug can be used with the ZX Interface 2).

If you want to reconfigure the joystick controls selection option 4.
This allows you to use any keys except: CAPS SHIFT and SYMBOL SHIFT which are
reserved.
B which selected the difficult game option
P which pauses and releases game play.

The Game
When you press the 'fire' button or B key the first of your 5 Millennium
Falcons will appear in the middle of the screen. Your remaining Falcons are
shown at the bottom of the screen.
The portals in the Death Star's enemy shield will not start appearing until
you have destroyed three Tie Interceptors.

The Death Star
As the game progresses you'll see that the Death Star is being built, defence
zone by defence zone. The white light you see, flashing intermittently, is
welding in progress. If it is completed the Death Ray will become fully
operational and will destroy your remaining Millennium Falcons, laying the
universe open to domination by the Empire.

The Imperial Shuttle
Aboard the Imperial Shuttle is Darth Vader. It isn't easy to destroy his
transporter but with the right moves and quick reactions it can be done. At
random points throughout the game you will hear a warning sound.
This means that the Imperial Shuttle is approaching. It if collides with your
Millennium Falcon you will be destroyed.

Round progression
Each time you destroy the Death Star the game will re-start automatically, but
the shuttle building the Death Star will move faster and faster.

The more points that you score the more often the Tie Interceptors will fire
at you.
