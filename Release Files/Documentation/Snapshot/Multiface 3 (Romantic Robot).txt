                    INTRODUCTION
 
MULTIFACE 3 is a multi-purpose interface designed exclusively
for the SPECTRUM+3. It provides fully automatic and universal
back-up/transfer of 48/128K programs from tape to disk, disk
to disk, tape to tape and disk to disk. It also incorporates
a comprehensive toolkit enabling you to study/modify/develop
software. MULTIFACE 3 can copy screens to printer in 2 hi-res
modes and it extends the use of DOS in 48 SPECTRUM mode.
MULTIFACE is menu-driven, fully error-trapped with on-screen
prompts and it largely uses a system of one-touch commands.
it is very easy to use and does not really need a separate
written manual. Nonetheless, the following few pages should
help you to understand every aspect of MULTIFACE 3 operations
so that you can use it to its fullest possible potential.

1                   CONNECTING MULTIFACE

1.1   Switch off and unplug your computer and any peripherals
      which have independent power supplies.
      Remove any peripherals attached to the expansion port.
1.2   Firmly push the MULTIFACE connector onto the expansion
      port.
1.3   Attach the other peripherals, if any, making sure they
      are pushed well home. Check all connections carefully.
1.4   Plug in the computer and peripherals and switch on.
1.5   Test that all is well by pressing the Red STOP button.
      If a 2-line menu comes up at the bottom of the screen,
      all is well and you can explore MULTIFACE further or
      press r to return and carry on with whatever you wish.
1.6   If you get random coloured squares, or other garbage,
      switch off, disconnect everything from the mains, clean
      both sides of the expansion port and repeat 1.2-1.5.
1.7   In the unlikely event that the screen remains corrupted
      or menu does not come up, switch off, remove all other
      peripherals, reread the instructions and retry 1.2-1.5.
1.8   If you still get no success, switch off again, remove
      MULTIFACE and contact Romantic Robot. Please note that
      repairs under guarantee are only carried out free of
      charge if the guarantee was registered.
    
1.9   Turning MULTIFACE ‘o’n and ‘o’ff
      MULTIFACE 3 has a software operated switch to prevent
      it clashing with other software or hardware products.
      The switch is also vital to enable loading programs
      saved by any previous MULTIFACE model. As a rule, upon
      switching the Spectrum+3 on, the MULTIFACE of OFF and
      therefore “invisible”. It is automatically switched ON
      anytime when you press the red button which has in fact
      a dual function: it both switches ON (but not OFF) and
      activates the MULTIFACE. Once the MULTIFACE is active,
      it remains ON as confirmed at the bottom right. To turn
      it off again, press o - when in the main menu – to
      change on to off; when yiu return to program,
      MULTIFACE will remain OFF. Remember, that MULTIFACE can
      always be activated by the red button, irrespective if
      it was ON or OFF before.

2                        LOADING

MULTIFACE does not save or transfer or change programs as
such, it saves an image, a snapshot (in a compressed form) of
the computer memory, frozen at the instant the red button was
pressed. It does not therefore matter how you loaded a
program in the first place, whether it was protected or not –
as long as you can LOAD a program, MULTIFACE will save it.
Upon reloading, everything is fully automatically restored
and the program autostarts from the point at which it was
stopped – make sure you have your hands at the fire button...

2.1   How to LOAD programs before saving
      It is essential to understand the differences between
      the 4 options available on the Spectrum+3, namely the
      +3 BASIC 128/48 mode and 48 BASIC locked mode. When you
      switch on or reset the Spectrum+3, you can select:
2.1.1 LOADER – goes into 128K mode, attempts to autoboot from
      disc and if it fails it proceeds to load from tape. In
      order to autoboot, the program must either be called
      “DISK” or the disk must contain a special “bootstrap”
      sector. This is important to remember and, when using
      MULTIFACE for saving, use the name “DISK” for the
      program you wish to autoboot (see 2.4).
    
2.1.2 +3 BASIC – defaults to 128K mode and DOS; you can then
2.1.2.1 load from disc – type LOAD “name” and press <ENTER>
2.1.2.2 load from tape – type LOAD “T:name” (or LOAD “T:”
                            and LOAD “”) and press <ENTER>
2.1.2.3 change to 48 BASIC – type SPECTRUM and press ENTER;
         to load from tape – press j to obtain LOAD, then
                             type “” (or “name”) and <ENTER>

        IMPORTANT!: Although the above 48 BASIC is unlocked,
        it does not itself give you any access to the disc
        operating system in BASIC. MULTIFACE, on the other
        hand, CAN even in this mode fully use the DOS which
        is extremely useful. Thus to
        load from disc – press dos in the main menu and then
                         load a program.
                         
2.1.3 Calculator – not really suitable for MULTIFACE use

2.1.4 48 BASIC – locks the Spectrum into a 48K mode where the
      disc operating system is NEVER available. This means
      that whilst you can use the MULTIFACE, you will only be
      able to save to tape; the disk option (just as the DOS
      option in the main menu) will not even be displayed. If
      you still wish to save to disc, you must first save to
      tape, switch off/reset, select +3 BASIC or LOADER, re-
      load the saved program from tape and then save to disc.
      
In summary, you can use
2.1.5 LOADER to 1) load from tape & later save to tape/disc
                2) load autobooting programs from disc and
                   later save to tape or disc
2.1.6 +3 BASIC to load any 48/128K program from tape or disc
              and save to tape/disc, even in 48 SPECTRUM mode
2.1.7 48 BASIC but load/save 48K programs from/to tape only
Or, in other words, if you have a
2.1.8.1 48K program on tape, use LOADER or +3 BASIC, but not
                   48 “locked” BASIC (it can’t save to disc)
2.1.8.2 128K program on tape, use LOADER or +3 BASIC
2.1.8.3 48/128 program on disc, use +3 BASIC – or LOADER if
                  the program autoboots; do not use 48 BASIC
                  
2.2                      SAVING

2.2.1 At any instant you wish to save a program or screen,
      press the RED button.
2.2.2 The main menu will appear at the bottom of the screen
      with 5-8 options, depending on which mode you are in.
      In LOADER and +3 BASIC in 128 and SPECTRUM mode:
              return save tool print dos alter clear
                                                 on
      In 48 locked mode:
              return save tool print           LOCKED
                                                  On
2.3   ‘C’learing before saving
      Before you proceed to save, decide first whether you
      wish to save the entire RAM, incl. the additional RAM
      banks, or not – this will influence the saving/loading
      time and the amount of code saved. When the Spectrum is
      switched on or reset, RAM banks 1,3,4,6 are marked
      throughout by E5 characters for RAM disc use (M Drive).
      It is good practice to clear these banks before loading
      (see also 2.5.3) to make sure that a program will load
      into a ‘clean’ computer. Obviously, with 128K programs,
      the extra RAM banks are important, but not all may be
      used – hence clear before loading. In 48K programs, the
      extra RAM banks are irrelevant and you can clear then
      any time, even after loading (except for the 48 locked
      mode with nothing to clear). Please note, that bank 7
      is never cleared as the SPECTRUM+3 uses it as workspace.
2.4   Naming a program
      Having pressed s to proceed to saving, the prompt will
      Change by asking for a filename. Unlike on normal disc
      Files, UP TO 7 letters/digits ONLY can be used. Letters
      can be typed both in lower and upper case but will be
      always taken as upper case only. Usual rules for
      filenames apply, with the exception that you cannot use
      extensions. The following are all legal filenames:
           DISK       NEVER12       WRIGGLE
      These are not:-
           Disk.bin   (no extensions allowed)
           Never m    (no spaces allowed)
           Wriggler   (too long)
           my,prog    (no punctuation marks allowed)
      Remember, that the name “DISK” will autoboot a disk.
2.4.1 If you suddenly decide NOT to save the program at this
      stage, pressing abort will take you back to the Main
      Menu, whilst r will return you to the program.

2.5   Saving menu options
      Upon ENTERing the filename, the display will change and
      you will see the following prompts:-
          abort   tape   disk             128K (or 48K)
          (screen or program)      compress ON (or OFF)
      Once again, you can abort to return to the main menu.
2.5.1 ‘P’rogram or ‘S’creen saving
      Pressing p or s lets you save the whole program or just
      the screen (see 4.2). Program is saved by default.
2.5.2 ‘C’ompressing
      MULTIFACE automatically compresses the whole RAM. The
      compression can be disabled by pressing c, but the only
      reason to do so is for disassembling the actual files
      saved by the MULTIFACE (true RAM image) – for m/code
      enthusiasts only! Please note that when saving screens,
      the compression is automatically turned off to preserve
      screens in their traditional – and compatible – format.
      
                      Saving (contd)
                    
2.5.3 Selecting the 48/128 ‘K’ format
      You do not really need to select the above option, but
      It can save loading/saving time and room on disc/tape.
      MULTIFACE can at this stage, no matter if you cleared
      In the main menu or not, save either the original 48K
      Spectrum blocks 5,2,0 or the entire 128K (blocks 0-7).
      Obviously choosing the 48K option in a 128K program
      would not make sense, but with 48K programs this will
      ensure that absolutely minimal amount of bytes will be
      saved. It must be noted though, that while it’s safe to
      use the 48K option with most 48K programs (always with
      the pre-Spectrum+3 programs or with pure m/code ones),
      you cannot use it when saving BASIC programs written in
      Spectrum+3 BASIC – these use RAM 7 without “letting you
      know” and the 48K option cuts out bank 7 completely.

      The main difference between the clear option in the
      main menu and the 48K option is, that clear does not
      clear bank 7 but it clears banks 1,3,4,6 (which are
      always used – either as a RAM disc or as RAM banks in
      128K programs – and would therefore be saved by the
      MULTIFACE with the rest). If you clear and then use
      128K option, MULTIFACE will compress the entire RAM,
      incl. the extra banks, and this may take a bit of time
      and room. If you use 48K option, it does not matter
      whether you cleared before or not; the MULTIFACE will
      waste no time in compressing anything else but the
      BASIC banks 5,2,0 and save just these - it is faster
      and more effective.

      There are two reasons to use clear:
      a) before LOADING a 128K program - the program may not
      use all 8 RAM banks and it is best to clear them first
      b) when you have a 48K BASIC program and are not sure
      if it uses RAM bank 7 or not – it is safer to clear and
      use 128K option.
      Please note, that in the locked 48 BASIC mode there is
      no 128K option and thus 48K option is not switchable.
      
2.5.4 Saving to ‘t’ape or ‘d’isc
      Having decided to save a program or screen, compress or
      not and use 48 or 128K mode (the defaults are a
      compressed program in 128K mode - or 48K in the locked
      mode), you can save to tape or disk.
2.5.4.1 To save to disc, press d: please ensure the disc is
      formatted and has sufficient space. MULTIFACE combines
      a thorough error-trapping with on-screen prompts – thus
      for instance, DRIVE NOT READY appears if the disk is
      not formatted or inserted, FILE TOO BIG if there is not
      enough space for the file to be saved in which case the
      amount of K needed as opposed to available on the disk
      flashes above.WRITE PROTECTED warns that protection tab
      on the disk prevents it to be used for saving. In all
      of these cases just insert another suitable disk and
      press ENTER to continue.
2.5.4.2 If saving to tape, make sure the tape is in position
      and is long enough. Press Play & Record on your tape
      recorder, then press <ENTER>.
2.6   When saving is complete, you will be returned to the
      Main Menu and you can then either return to continue
      the program or use any other function of MULTIFACE 3.

3                     RELOADING PROGRAMS

3.1   MULTIFACE must be attached to reload programs it saved.
      It also needs to be ON (see 1.9). If it is OFF, you
      will be reminded to turn it ON once the program starts
      loading: message M3 LOADING will change to M3 NOT ON!.
      Just press the red button and return – M3 LOADING will
      come up again and the program will soon load.
3.2   Selecting Spectrum+3 modes for loading
      You can use LOADER or +3 BASIC (128K and Spectrum mode)
      to reload programs saved by the MULTIFACE. The programs
      will automatically configure themselves - you can even
      load a 128K program into the Spectrum (48K) mode and it
      will adjust itself. You cannot, however, load a 128K
      program into the 48 BASIC mode and are not advised to
      use this mode anyway - you can use it to load 48K
      MULTIFACE programs, but cannot save them to disc then!
3.3   Loading multi-part programs from disc
      MULTIFACE 3 allows you to load a program from within a
      program - this can be very convenient for loading
      multi-part programs. Generally, you have to save this
      type of programs at various stages (mostly when they
      take another part from tape or disc). Say you do this
      at the beginning of each part and end up with 4 parts,
      or rather 4 programs saved by the MULTIFACE. When you
      re-load the first, play it and reach part No.2, you can
      press the red button, go into the DOS option and load:
      when asked for a filename, use the 2nd part name and
      MULTIFACE will load it and overwrite the current part.
     
4                      PRINT and ALTER

4.1   ‘P’rint command
      Pressing p dumps a screen to a printer via the Spectrum
      printer port provided your printed has EPSON graphics
      compatibility.By using the TOOLKIT to poke the relevant
      addresses, you can choose a large or shaded copy, set
      line feed, all margins and even line spacing:
      2008H (8200 decimal): 01 – Large Copy with CR and LF
                                (carriage return + line feed)
                            F1 – Shaded copy with CR and LF
                            00 – Large Copy with CR only
                            F0 – Shaded Copy with CR only
      200BH (8203 decimal): 08 – sets left margin (0-255)
      200CH (8204 decimal): 23 – sets bottom margin (0-23)
      200DH (8205 decimal):  0 – sets top margin (0-23)
      200E-2010H (8206-8):  27,51,23 (ESC “3” n) – sets line
                            spacing in n/216; some printers
                            require a different syntax – say
                            27,65,3 (ESC “A” n – in n/32) for
                            Brother HR5
      2011-2014H (8209-12): 27,76,0,3 (ESC “L” n m) – sets
                            the graphic mode
                            
4.2   ‘A’lter screens (in 128K mode only!)
      SPECTRUM+3 allows the use of two different screens – in
      addition to the standard 16384-23296 screen, there is a
      provision for a second screen at 49152-56064. MULTIFACE
      allows to see/save/print both screens (see 2.5.1, 4.1)
      and the a key lets you swap them at will. The screen
      shown is the one that can be saved or copied. Since the
      2nd screen area may not always be used as a screen, you
      may end up getting a black square or garbage – just
      press a again to call back the original screen.
      
                       DOS and TOOLKIT
                     
4.3   ‘D’OS (Disc Operating System)
      MULTIFACE can access the DOS any time except when you
      are in 48 BASIC. There are two main reasons to use it:
4.4   ‘L’oading from disc
      You can load any program from disc here, even when you
      are in the +3 BASIC SPECTRUM mode! You may simply find
      it more convenient upon switching the SPECTRUM+3 on to
      press the MULTIFACE red button, choose dos and load a
      program – rather than selecting Loader or +3BASIC and
      then typing in all necessary Spectrum syntax, etc. Also
      see 3.2 for loading multi-part programs – invaluable!
4.5   ‘E’rasing files
      You may find it necessary to erase files from disk at
      times – MULTIFACE may say that FILE is TOO BIG to save
      and display the amount of K required. You can at such
      stage use dos to erase: MULTIFACE will show you a file
      at a time in the bottom line with its name and length
      and ask you yes/no to erase it or not. You can in a way
      catalogue discs by using no all the time, as files will
      infinitely scroll in the bottom line. You can abort
      erasing and then abort again to go to the main menu.
      
5.1   Accessing The Toolkit
      Press t from the main menu to obtain the toolkit menu:
      quit ENTpoke SPCaddr reg win hx txt pr s
5.2   Quit
      You can quit any time back to the main menu.
5.3   ENTER key
      ENTER has a twofold role – it lets you both PEEK & POKE:
5.3.1 If you type in a number (0-255 Decimal, &00-&FF Hex),
      pressing ENTER will POKE it into the current address.
5.3.2 If you wish to PEEK only, do NOT input any number, just
      press ENTER. By pressing ENTER repeatedly, you can step
      through successive addresses. You can again POKE any
      time by inputting a number before pressing ENTER.
5.3.3 SPACE key
      Pressing the SPACE key enables you to enter an address
      (in Hex or Decimal – see 5.4) which you wish to inspect
      or alter. You will now be able to alter and inspect
      successive addresses as detailed in 5.3.1-5.3.2 above.
5.4   ‘H’ex or Decimal
      This toggles the bottom display and input line between
      Hex and Decimal. When you input a number, please ensure
      which mode you are in: MULTIFACE has no way of knowing
      whether a number was meant to be in Hex or Decimal and
      thus 10 will be in 10 in Decimal but 16 in Hex, etc.
5.5   ‘R’egisters
      At the moment of pressing the red button, MULTIFACE
      stores the contents of all the registers in its own
      RAM. Pressing r allows you to inspect and alter them at
      will. Each successive location stores the contents of a
      single 8 bit register or of half a 16 bit register. In
      all cases, registers are stored in INTEL format with
      the low byte first, followed by the high byte. The
      order in which they are stored is as follows:
      PC IY IX BC’ DE’ HL’ AF’ BC DE R- I- HL AF SP
      Thus on pressing R, you will see the memory location
      16356 (&3FE4), its contents and letters ‘pC’ – the low
      byte of the PC pair. Press <ENTER> to see the next
      address (16357), its value and letters ‘Pc’, i.e. the
      high byte of the PC register.

5.6   ‘W’indow
      Pressing w opens a window with 16 lines of 8 bytes each.
      The window opens ‘around’ the current address used in
      the bottom line and shows it flashing in the 5th line.
5.6.1 Window Full Screen Editing
      The window is not just a passive display. Full screen
      editing is possible, making peeking and poking so much
      easier. When you scroll/move through the window in any
      direction, the cursor movement is reflected in the
      bottom line and the address and value (corresponding to
      the flashing window cursor) change accordingly. Thus if
      you find an address in the window by moving the
      flashing cursor, it will be simultaneously shown at the
      SPACE/ENTER, the window will open around it. You can
      use the cursor keys for moving a byte or a line at a
      time. The left & right cursor keys move the cursor as
      you would expect, but the up and down cursors scroll
      the whole display, keeping the cursor where it is. In
      other words, by using the up cursor you actually
      decrement addresses, whilst the down cursor increments.
      There are two more ‘hidden keys’ for editing:
          minus moves the whole page (128 bytes) backwards
          next moves the whole page forward (see also 5.8)
5.7   ‘T’est
      The window contents are by default shown in Hex,
      irrespective of the status of the bottom line – the h
      key has no effect on the window. However, the TOOLKIT
      has another powerful feature in translating the window
      into ASCII codes – which is what the t key does. By
      toggling it you can view everything as text – this is
      very handy in revealing messages (and easily modifying
      them) or just showing the code makes no sense as text.
5.8   ‘P’rint
      You can print out the window contents. MULTIFACE uses
      ASCII DUMP here and prints out characters/numbers only.
      To print out a longer section of code, use SPACE/ENTER
      to input the start address, print the window, go to
      next window, print again, etc. Line feed can be turned
      on/off by poking 8200 with 1/0.
5.9   ‘S’elect a RAM bank
      The TOOLKIT operates within a 64K area of which the
      bottom 48K is strictly defined but the remaining top
      16K is switchable and can be used as a viewing/working
      area for all 8 RAM banks (Nos. 0-7). As a rule:
          0- 8191 (&0000-&1FFF) is the old Spectrum BASIC ROM
       8192-16383 (&2000-&3FFF) is the MULTIFACE’s 8K RAM
      16384-32767 (&4000-&7FFF) is Spectrum RAM block No.5
      32768-49151 (&8000-&BFFF) is Spectrum RAM block No.2
      49152-65535 (&C000-&BFFF) defaults to showing RAM No.0,
      but pressing s followed by a number 0-7 will page the
      corresponding RAM here and you can inspect/alter it.
      Upon leaving the toolkit RAM No.0 will be automatically
      paged back here (see also Spectrum manual p.182, etc.).
      
6.0                 THE USE OF EXTRA 8K RAM

      The MULTIFACE’s 8K RAM extension can be accessed and
      used for other purposes. This, however, requires a good
      knowledge of machine code plus further information on
      how to access the RAM extension - this is available on
      request and can be forwarded to you if you send a SAE.
