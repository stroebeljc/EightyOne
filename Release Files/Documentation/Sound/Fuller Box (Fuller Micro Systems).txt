OPERATION OF THE PROGRAMMABLE SOUND GENERATOR (PSG)

At the heart of the Fuller Box lies the well known AY-3-8912 PSG chip.

The chip has 14 internal registers, each dealing with its own specific operation.

To create sound effects or music the user must enter the necessary data into these
registers.

The user must first select the desired register, then enter the data.

From BASIC these operations are obtained by two 'OUT' commands:

    To select the register - OUT 63,REG
    To enter data into REG - OUT 95,DATA

For example, to put data 100 into register 6:

    OUT 63,6: OUT 95,100


REGISTER FUNCTIONS

Registers 0 - 5 are three pairs of tone value registers, for each of the three sound
channels A, B and C.
0 and 1 are FINE and COARSE for channel A
2 and 3 are FINE and COARSE for channel B
4 and 5 are FINE and COARSE for channel C

The COARSE values lie between 0 and 15 (high pitch to low pitch).
The FINE values lie between 0 and 255 (high - low).

Register 6 is the filter frequency of the built in white noise or hiss generator.
Values range from 0 for a high "ssssh" to 31 giving a low "grumble". Noise is
available at any time on any of the three sound channels, register 6 controlling
the overall filter frequency.

Register 7 is the "switching" control of the PSG chip. The 8 binary bits that
make up the decimal number of the data in register 7 have their own individual
purpose.

They are used to switch on TONE and/or NOISE on any of the three sound channels.
See Figure 1 for details.


FIGURE 1

The 8 binary bits of register 7 in the PSG have their own individual function. On
being reset to binary 0 they switch on NOISE or TONE on the three channels.

          +----------+------+---------+---------+
          |      BIT | 7  6 | 5  4  3 | 2  1  0 |
          |          |      |  NOISE  |   TONE  |
          | function | -  - | C  B  A | C  B  A |
          +----------+------+---------+---------+

TO SWITCH ON TONE:-
ON CHANNEL A SUBTRACT 1    :    TO SWITCH OFF ADD 1
ON CHANNEL B SUBTRACT 2    :    TO SWITCH OFF ADD 2
ON CHANNEL C SUBTRACT 4    :    TO SWITCH OFF ADD 4

TO SWITCH ON NOISE:-
ON CHANNEL A SUBTRACT 8    :    TO SWITCH OFF ADD 8
ON CHANNEL B SUBTRACT 16   :    TO SWITCH OFF ADD 16
ON CHANNEL C SUBTRACT 32   :    TO SWITCH OFF ADD 32


Subtract or add numbers from current contents of the register to turn on TONE or
NOISE.

So, for example to switch on NOISE on channel B:

   10 OUT 63,7 : REM select register 7
   20 OUT 95,(255-16) : REM bit 4 low

to hear this, set volume of channel B to a medium level:

   30 OUT 63,9 : REM select register 9 - volume of channel B
   40 OUT 95,8

to turn the NOISE off:

   50 OUT 63,9 : OUT 95,0
or 50 OUT 63,7 : OUT 95,(255-16+16)

both these lines have the effect of turning off the NOISE on channel B.

Registers 8, 9 and 10 are the volume level controls for channels A, B and C
respectively.

Values between 0 and 15 (silent to loudest) are used. Any value greater than 15
in any of the three registers will transfer volume control of that channel to the
automatic envelope generator.

Registers 11 and 12 set the length of time for one envelope cycle (initial rise
in volume to final decay).
Register 11 is the FINE control with values 0 to 255 (fast to slow).
Register 12 is the COARSE control with values 0 to 255 (fast to very slow).

Register 13 is the envelope shape selector. There are a number of preset
envelopes for use, a table of these is given in Fig. 2.
