=================================================
S-PACK (Speech Pack) for the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum
DCP Microdevelopments Ltd
=================================================

The DCP Speech Pack is a completely self contained add-on Speech
Synthesiser for the ZX81 or Spectrum computer and is supplied fully
assembled and tested. It can be used in addition to a ZX RAM PACK,
DCP PACK and/or ZX Printer by simply plugging in these to the rear
of the S-Pack.

The S-Pack is supplied complete with Word Pack ROM 1 which contains
all the letters of the alphabet, numbers zero to over a million
and some other general words which can all be 'spoken' under computer
control using simple POKE or OUT commands. Up to three more Word
Pack ROM's can be fitted and details of these are given later. (Different
Word Packs will be available later in addition to those listed here.) The
two versions of the Speech Pack for the Spectrum and ZX81 are operated
in a similar way but are NOT interchangeable; i.e. a Spectrum Speech
Pack should not be used on a ZX81 and vice versa.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING THE PACK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the Speech Pack first remove the power plug from your
computer along with any other packs you may have fitted on the back.
Plug the S-Pack into the rear of the computer and re-connect the ZX
power (ignore any speech or sound that comes out of the S-Pack after
power up).

The 'K' cursor or '©Sinclair Research Ltd' should appear as normal.
Then enter in this following simple command to try your S-Pack:

For ZX81: POKE 49149,0 (followed by NEWLINE)
For SPECTRUM: OUT 255,0 (followed by NEWLINE)

The Speech Pack should respond by announcing itself. You can see
from the Word Pack 1 list that 49149 or 255 is the address of Word Pack 1
and 0 is the code for "This is Digitalker"*


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOFTWARE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use Speech in your programs simply choose where you want the
word or phrase and insert a POKE or OUT command as before. (POKE
and OUT are fully explained in the ZX manual). You will find it easier
if you make a variable (example "S") equal to the Speech Word Pack
address you are using:-

For ZX81: LET S=49149 (or 49148 for Word Packs 3 and 4.)
For SPECTRUM: LET S=255 (or 223 for Word Packs 3 and 4.)

Make this one of the first lines in your program. Then decide which
word or words you want the Speech Pack to speak and enter their
corresponding codes from the Word Pack list into POKE or OUT
commands:-

For ZX81: POKE S,(number code of word to be spoken)
For SPECTRUM: OUT S,(number code of word to be spoken)

If you wish to use a string of words you must insert PAUSE commands
between the POKE or OUT commands otherwise the Speech Pack will try
to say all the words at once! As a rough guide PAUSE 50 is equal to about
one second delay and so depending on the length of the words shorter or
longer PAUSE's may be required.

If you have extra Word Pack ROM's you can make words plural by
adding "SS". "ED" or "TH" sounds onto the end of them (see Word Pack
lists). You can also join two words together to make one (e.g. "Twenty-
Three") - as soon as you command the Speech Pack to speak a new word
it will stop the previous one and start the new word. You will need to
experiment with different PAUSE delays to get the best results.

This short program contains a FOR-NEXT loop that when RUN counts
from one to twenty at one second intervals.

ZX81 Program:

10 LET S=49149
20 FOR A=1 TO 20
30 POKE S,A
40 PAUSE 50
50 NEXT A


ZX SPECTRUM Program:

10 LET S=255
20 FOR A=1 TO 20
30 OUT S,A
40 PAUSE 50
50 NEXT A


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPANSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have other ZX Packs you can disconnect the power plug from the
computer and plug them onto the rear of the S-Pack. You can then
reconnect the ZX power and use the S-Pack as before. The power supply
must be capable of supplying enough current both for the computer +
Speech Pack and the other accessories as well. (If in doubt consult your
dealer).

The Volume level of the Speech Pack may be adjusted by carefully
inserting a very small screwdriver into the volume slot and adjusting
the control to the required level.

An external speaker or earphone may be connected to the 3.5mm jack
socket - this must have an impedance of 8R.

Add-on Word Pack ROM's are available and simply plug into sockets
inside the Speech Pack - full instructions are provided with each Word
Pack.

For details of these and other DCP ZX add-ons including Interspec,
Analogue, Control and Peripheral Packs contact your dealer or DCP
Microdevelopments direct.
