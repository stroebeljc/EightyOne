Spectrum Speech Synthesizer

First make sure the computer is disconnected by removing the
power cord. The interface must be plugged into the Spectrum ex-
pansion port or into existing interfaces which have a piggy-back
edge connector at their rear. The computer can then be switched on
by inserted the power connector.


SPEECH SYNTHESIS

The Spectrum speech synthesis utilises parts of the spoken word
known as allophones. These are actual sounds that go to make up
speech. The SP0256 allophone speech synthesis technique provides
the ability to synthesize an unlimited vocabulary. Fifty-nine discrete
speech sounds (allophones) and five pauses are stored in the speech
chip's internal rom (see page 13 for allophone table). In the past
speech synthesis has required large data bases to store words
because every word had to have its own set of data. This method of
speech synthesis is slightly clearer than the SP0256 chip but would
require at least 5 mega-bytes of memory to store the English
language. This is obviously not practical. Therefore, for the home
computer the SP0256 is the ideal chip.


LOADING DETAILS FOR SOFTWARE SUPPLIED

The software supplied with your Spectrum Speech Synthesizer has
been recorded three times on both sides of the cassette, so if one
version fails 10 load you have five other copies. To load the software
type: LOAD ""

And press ENTER. The software comes in two parts. The first part
is the relocater, this enables you to load and run the software any-
where in the Basic memory map between 31200 and 60500. This
allows other software to reside with the Speech synthesizer software.
However if you want to use Dk‘tronics centronics port it is necessary
to load the centronics port software first and then load the speech
software as described above. The second Part is the machine code
to run the text to speech convertor, this is about 4.7K in length.
After the first part has loaded the screen will clear and ask you for
the load address. This should be in the range 31200 to 60500 (60500
is a good address). The routines will automatically lower the top
of basic if necessary so that basic programs will not erase the soft-
ware. It is important to remember the load address if you intend
using the text to speech convertor from machine cade or it you type
NEW. You will probably want to do this straight after the software

                             - - -

has loaded and you are left with the loader program. Type New then
when the computer is ready type:

RANDOMISE USR [Load address].

The software is now again ready for use. Alternatively your own
programs may start with RANDOMISE USR (Load address).

Once the second part has loaded the machine code will perform
the initialisation routine and print the copyright message on the
screen.


HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE FROM BASIC

The program you have loaded will set up an interrupt driven program
to handle the speech allophones. This simply means that the
computer will continue to say a list of allophones, each time check-
ing that the last one has finished being spoken. All this can take
place without you knowing so you can get the computer to do other
tasks while the speech chip is speaking. Also the program changes
the interpretation of the LPRINT statement so that the speech
commands can be easily used from basic. When you want to send
a command to the speech chip software there is a new syntax to
use:

      (1) LPRINT "|XXXX,n,n..."
      (2) LPRINT "\hello there"
      (3) LPRINT "print this.."

Command (3) is the normal LPRINT statement, but (1) and (2)
alter the LPRINT statement and now go to the speech software.
Hence any characters in an LPRINT statement will be sent to the
speech software if they start with 'or'. More about (2) in a minute
but here is a list of commands to use for (1) in place of XXXX:-

LPRINT "|SPON"      This turns on the interrupt and reads out any allophones
(speech on)         that are there.
LPRINT "|SPOF"      This turns off the interrupt and stops reading the buffer.
(speech off)
LPRINT "|FEED,n.."  This is use to feed the speech buffer direct and also for
                    sound effects. The ¦FEED,n command is followed by a
                    maximum of 30 data items separated by commas.
LPRINT "|FLUS"      This command clears the speech buffer and silences the
                    speech chip.
LPRINT "|SPED,n"    This command controls the speed at which the words are
                    spoken. n is a number from 0 to 15.
LPRINT "|OUTM,1"    Sets access to 'text to speech' convertor by use of
                    LPRINT "\text to convert" only.
LPRINT "|OUTM,2"    Sets access to 'text to speech' convertor from all outputs
                    of LPRINT and LLIST.

                             - - -

Note. The | character is found on the S key and the \ character is
found on the D key. Both are accessed from entering EXTENDED
mode (pressing both shifts simultaneously) then pressing shift S
and D respectively.


SPEECH SYNTHESIZER

The speech synthesizer can be used in various modes.

(1).  Direct without software supplied.
(2).  Using LPRINT "|FEED,n..." command.
(3).  Using 'text to speech' convertor.
(4).  Using print mode commands.


[1].  Direct without software supplied.

The speech chip is in the I/0 memory map location 127. It is poss-
ible to send data straight to this location but the correct allophones
must be worked out and converted to date manually. Also the prog-
ram most find out when the speech chip has finished saying each
allophone by reading from I/0 location 127 and waiting until its
value is 127.

The following simple example shows a program to send data to
the speech chip:-

10 FOR X=1 TO 9: REM length of DATA statement.
20 IF IN 127<>127 THEN GO TO 20: REM wait for chip ready signal.
30 READ A
40 OUT 127,A
50 NEXT X: STOP
60 DATA 42,15,16,9,49,22,13,51,0

This example is using the speech chip in its crudest form and
requires the component parts of the text to be converted into data.
To do this use the allophone table at the back of this instruction
book, also see word table. An example of the word computer is:-

WORD     C   O   M   P  U   T   E   R

DATA     42, 15, 16, 9, 49, 22, 13, 51, 0

Note: The 0 at the end of the data is to stop the last allophone from
sounding forever.

                             - - -

[2]. Using the LPRINT "|FEED.n.." Command.

This requires that the software supplied is first loaded (see page 2
for loading instructions).

The LPRINT "|FEED" command allows allophones to be sent
directly into the speech buffer. The LPRINT is an extended keyword
found on the letter C. The |FEED part is typed letter for letter.
Once the converted data has been entered using this command the
speech chip will say the allophones one after another under interrupt
control, i.e. transparent. This means that once the data is in the
buffer the computer can carry on with another task. The data is
the same as for the direct mode (see section 1) and has to be looked
up from the allophone table on page 13.

Example:-

LPRINT "|FEED,33,19,4,42,20,4,17,39,23,56,12,41,55,4,45,12,16,17,17,12,21,0"

When you enter the above the computer will say DK TRONICS LTD.
See word table for other examples or construct your Own. This
mode is much easier to use than the direct mode (1) but still req-
uires you to convert the words into allophones. It is most useful
for creating sound effects.

Example:-  LPRINT "|FEED,62,62,62,62"

           Will produce a pulsating sound

and        LPRINT "|FEED,41,41,41"

           Will produce a knocking sound

You can try any numbers from 5 to 63 for different effects.


[3]. 'Text to Speech' Convertor.

The software supplied is mainly devoted to this mode of operation.
Of the 4.7K of program some 3.5K is used for tables containing
rules, and exceptions to the rule, for the English language.
It is therefore the most important mode and allows speech to be
entered in normal English without any converting to data by the
user. The software must first be loaded (see page 2 for loading
instructions.)

                             - - -

The 'text to Speech' uses two new commands:-

LPRINT "|SPON"

This command turns on the speech interrupts.

LPRINT "|SPOF"

This command turns off the speech interrupts.

The text which you want to be spoken must be marked by a new
control character (LPRINT mode (2) see page 5). This character
is typed by entering Spectrum extended mode and pressing shift
D character.

Example:-

LPRINT "\hello there speech chip."

None of the above will actually appear on the printer hence it is
necessary to never use | or \ in normal LPRINT statements if you
want to use the printer.

'Text to speech' can best be explained by the following examples.

10 LPRINT "|SPON"
20 LPRINT "\This is talking"
30 LPRINT "\and so is this."

Line 10 is only necessary at the start of the program. Also note the
use of both upper and lower case, which can be interchanged and
mixed as you require. Any graphics in the LPRINT "\..." state-
ments will not be spoken but may give funny effects!

The 'text to speech' can handle 98% of all English words. There
are a few words which cause the 'text to speech' slight problems.
This is mainly because while there are rules for constructing words
i.e. I before E except after C, there are more exceptions to the rules
than actual rules. These problems can often be overcome by mis-
spelling the word. Type in the following:

LPRINT "|SPON"
LPRINT "\Silicon"

This word sounds wrong. However, type in:

LPRINT “\Silickon"

                             - - -

The word now sounds correct even though it has been misspelt,
with some words it may be necessary to experiment with the
spelling although this should be rare. Speech can also be sent to
the speech chip using string variables or even string expressions:

Example:

10 LET A$="\speech"
20 LPRINT "|SPON"
30 LPRINT A$

or

10 INPUT "What is your name ";A$
20 LPRINT "|SPON"
30 LPRINT "\Hello there ";A$;" how are you today"

Speech can be used in string expressions:

Example:

10 LPRINT "|SPON"
20 FOR I=65 TO 90
30 LPRINT "\";CHR$(I)
40 NEXT I


'TEXT TO SPEECH' BUFFERS.

The text to speech uses two RAM buffers. The text buffer to hold
the words entered by using LPRINT "\.." and the speech buffer
to hold the allophones which are outputted by the interrupt as they
are needed by the chip.

The text buffer can hold 100 characters and the speech butter is
larger and can hold 250 allophones. It is possible to fill either
buffer in which case some text or speech is lost. Hence it is advis-
able to send less than 100 characters at a time to the text to speech
convertor (about 3 lines on the Spectrum screen).

The speech buffer will hold about 45 seconds worth of speech and
will continue to talk after the program has finished or the BREAK
key has been pressed. There are two ways to stop this, after all
45 seconds of unwanted speech can get a bit nauseating.

First type in:

10 FOR I=1 TO 50
20 LPRINT "\The fat cat sat down"
30 NEXT I

                             - - -

After typing RUN you will see the 0 OK, 0:1 message but the com-
puter will continue to speak. To stop the computer type:

LPRINT "|FLUS"

The computer will abruptly stop speaking and will now be ready
to say anything you tell it to immediately,

Alternatively you might type:

LPRINT "|SPOF"

This stops the computer from speaking but leaves the buffers
still intact and hence the text can be restarted. This can be useful
if the computer is in midstream of a sentence and you want to stop
for a second while you answer the door for example.

Example:

10 LPRINT "|SPON"
20 LPRINT "\Once upon a time there was a beautiful princess"
30 IF INKEY$="S" THEN GO SUB 60
40 IF PEEK (60514)<200 THEN GO TO 30; REM *
50 GO TO 20
60 LPRINT "|SPOF": REM halt the speech.
70 IF INKEY$<>"G" THEN GO TO 70
80 LPRINT "|SPON": REM restart speech.
90 RETURN

* This value is the original load address (see page 2) plus 14 and it
contains the number of free positions in the speech buffer (max 250).
Also see section on machine code.


[4]. Using Printing Mode Commands,

LPRINT "|OUTM,1"

This command allows access to the 'text to speech' convertor by
use of LPRINT "\...." only. Hence listings and normal LPRINT
output will not be spoken but sent to the printer if it is there. It
is the default setting and hence is only any use for cancelling out
LPRINT "|OUTM,2".

LPRINT "|OUTM,2"

                             - - -

This command allows access to the 'text to speech' convertor from
all LPRINT output except commands in the form LPRINT "|XXXX".
Thus if you type LLIST the computer will actually say the listing.
To stop the computer when it is listing press down the shift and
space simultaneously until the computer responds with the cursor.

Then type LPRINT "|FLUS" if you are fed up with the speech.

Example:-

To say a listing:

LPRINT "|OUTM,2"
LLIST

Note that while in mode 2 the computer will wait for space in the
speech buffer before it says anything (hence causing some delay
before the computer responds to the BREAK key), mode 1 will lose
any extra text that is sent after the speech buffer fills up. This can
cause some unexpected effects so you are recommended to check
that there is sufficient space in the buffer by sampling PEEK
([Load address] + 14) and making sure it is greater than about 200.


The LPRINT "|SPED,n" Commend.

The LPRINT "|SPED,n" commend controls the speed at which
the speech chip will talk. This is useful as slightly slower sounds on
complicated words are easier to understand. Type in the following:

10 LPRINT "|SPON": REM turn on speech interrupts.
2O LPRINT "|SFED,0"
30 LPRINT "\This is fast"
40 FOR I=1 TO 1000: NEXT I
50 LPRINT "|SPED,7"
60 LPRINT "\This is slow"

The number that you use in place of 'n' has to be in the range 0
to 15. The LPRINT "|SPED,n" command also works with the
speech generated from LPRINT "|FEED,n,n,n.." command.

                             - - -

Example:-

10 LPRINT "|SPON": REM turn on speech interrupts
20 LPRINT "|SPED,1"
30 LPRINT "|FEED,26,16,55,17,39,21,0"
40 FOR I=1 TO 1000: NEXT I
50 LPRINT "|SPED,9"
60 LPRINT "|FEED,42,23,16,9,49,31,17,52,0"


OTHER SYNTAX NOTES. [experienced users only!]

While all the examples so far have used each LPRINT for only one
task it is possible to use one LPRINT statement to control all the
functions: printer, speech commands and text to convert. Each
part must start with its own control character and to reinitialise the
printer after using speech use the ~ character which is typed by
entering extended mode and pressing shift A.

Example:-

LPRINT "|SPON |FEED,41,4,41,4,41\come in please.~hello there printer"

Note how the printer text is at the end of the statement so that the
carriage return causes the printer to print its text. If the text is in
the middle:

LPRINT "|SPON~hello there printer:FEED,41,4,41,4,41\come in please."

Then no carriage return is sent to the printer and it will retain the
text until a carriage return is sent.


USING SPEECH FROM MACHINE CODE.

The speech chip can be used from machine code in two different
ways. The quickest way is to send data direct to the speech chip
very similar to the direct basic method (page 4). Date is calculated
from the allophone tables and then sent to the speech chip one by
one as the speech chip finishes the last allophone. The other method
is to use the cassette software supplied. It is loaded to where you
want it to lay in memory (see loading instructions page 2). Then all
you need to do is call some of the routines which it contains,

                             - - -

TEXT TO SPEECH MACHINE CODE CALLS.

ORIGIN         Initialisation routine.
                    (this relocates the whole routine and sets up chip)

ORIGIN + 2     Output allophone in accumulator to speech buffer.

ORIGIN + 4     Output string of text pointed to by HL pair and terminated
               by a zero byte. This text is converted into allophones and
               spoken under interrupt control.

ORIGIN + 6     Same as LPRINT "|SPON"

ORIGIN + 8     Same as LPRINT "|SPOF"

ORIGIN + 10    Same as LPRINT "|FLUS"

ORIGIN + 12    Same as LPRINT "|SPED,n" where the speed is in the
               accumulator.

ORIGIN + 14    This location contains the number of free spaces in the
               speech buffer.

Where ORIGIN is the load address for the software.

For example if your load address was 39000 then the LPRINT
"|SPON" routine is located at location 39006.


Example of Text to Speech in Machine Code.

ORIGIN:   EQU Load address.
          CALL ORIGIN + 6
          LD HL,STRING
          CALL ORIGIN + 4
          RET
STRING:   DEFB "david",0

Note the last character must be zero.

If there is a lot of text to be spoken then it is best to check how much
room there is left in the speech buffer by loading the contents of
ORIGIN +14:

LD A,(ORIGIN + 14)

                             - - -

EXAMPLE OF CHANGING THE SPEED.

LD A,10
CALL ORIGIN + 12
RET

NOTE If you disable the interrupts (DI) then the speech chip will
stop talking until they are enabled again (EI) and any allophone
presently being spoken may continue sounding until the EI is
issued. Hence it is advisable to output a zero directly to the speech
chip.


Basic Example:

OUT 127,0


Machine Code Examples:

LD BC,127
LD A,0
OUT (C),0
RET
