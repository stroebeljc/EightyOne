INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

Enclosed with your "Sweet Talker" you will find a demonstration tape
which will explain precisely how to program it.

In order to prevent damage to your "Sweet talker" or computer please
ensure that your computer is switched off before plugging or unplugging
the unit. Then simply plug it into the user port at the rear of the
computer - it will take its power from the existing power supply.

Other accessories, including the "Cheetah" 32K Ram Pack (Spectrum) /
"Cheetah" 16K and 64K Ram Packs (ZX81) can be used via
the card edge connector at the rear of the "Sweet Talker".
Now simply load "Chatbox" and make yourself a friend.

TECHNICAL NOTES

The ZX81 version of the interface uses output port $07 (decoding address lines
A7-A3), whereas the Spectrum version uses output port $1F (decoding address
lines A7-A5) to make it compatible with the ZX Interface 1.

The Spectrum version of the interface asserts the WAIT line until an allophone
has finished being rendered. The drawback of this approach is that it stops the
CPU performing other tasks while the allophone is being played. For the ZX81
version, it is necessary to execute a pause long enough for the speech to finish
being rendered.
