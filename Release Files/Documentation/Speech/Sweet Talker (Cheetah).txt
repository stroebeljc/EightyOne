the unit. Then simply plug it into the user port at the rear of the
computer - it will take its power from the existing power supply.

TECHNICAL NOTES

There were two revisions of the Sweet Talker. The first revision used
output port $07 (decoding address lines A7-A3). This was incompatible
on the Spectrum fitted with the ZX Interface 1 and so revision 2 changed
to output port $1F (decoding address lines A7-A5).

The interface asserts the WAIT line until an allophone has finished being
rendered. The drawback of this approach is that is stops the CPU performing
other tasks while the allophone is being played.
