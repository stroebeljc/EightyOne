1. SETTING UP THE CURRAH MICROSPEECH

The CURRAH MicroSpeech is an allophone speech synthesiser, which means
that it uses individual speech sounds strung together to make
intelligible speech. This is different to some speech synthesiser
available today which have a fixed vocabulary; unlike these systems
the MicroSpeech has an unlimited vocabulary and can synthesise any
word or sentence in the English language. The user merely has to
become familiar with he speech sounds of English (which are different
from letters) and the allophone symbols used to represent them.

To set up the unit, remove it from its packing tray if you have not
already done so, UNPLUG THE SPECTRUM FROM ITS POWER SUPPLY, and plug
the unit into the port on the back of the Spectrum, CURRAH logo
uppermost. You will find that there are two short leads at the back of
the MicroSpeech unit:

        - A UHF lead (this is the one with the Phono plug)
        - A line lead (this has a 3.5mm jack plug on it)

Remove the Spectrum's TV lead from the "TV" socket on the back of the
Spectrum and plug in the short UHF lead instead. Then take the
Spectrum's TV lead and plug it into the Phono socket on the back of
the MicroSpeech. This now allows speech to be "mixed" with the
Spectrum's video signal so that it comes from the TV speaker.

Now take the line lead and plug it into the "MIC" socket on the back
of the Spectrum (you cannot do any harm if you plug it into the "EAR"
socket by mistake). This lead allows the sound generated by the
Spectrum's own internal loudspeaker to come from the TV speaker -
simply remove this lead when you wish to use a cassette recorder with
your Spectrum.

Plug in the power lead to the Spectrum. The Spectrum will initialise
and the message:

        "Speech System (c) CURRAH 1983"

will appear at the top of the screen, as well as the normal Sinclair
Research Ltd. copyright message. If this does not happen, unplug the
power, check that you have connected the unit up correctly, and try
again.

Turn up the volume on your television (about half-way will do) and
press ENTER. The unit will say "enter". If it does not, there are two
simple checks you can do:

        -       Make sure you have pressed ENTER - the unit will
                remain silent until the first ENTER is pressed after a
                power up, a NEW, or after a "report" has been printed
                at the bottom of the screen.

        -       If you can hear the voice but it is very quiet or a
                little distorted, the UHF trimmer on the top right
                corner of the case may need adjusting. Using a small
                screwdriver, carefully turn the trimmer until you get
                the best quality speech with the least interference -
                keep pressing ENTER as you do this to hear the
                voice. Don't worry about turning the screw too far -
                it goes round and round without a stop - but you
                should find that an adjustment a fraction of a turn is
                all that you need.

Now try pressing any of the keys (remember to press ENTER first if
you have just switched on). All BASIC keywords and printable
characters are voiced, (with the exception of the "~" character) so
when LET appears on the screen you will hear the word "let" - go on -
try it! Note that all graphics characters are voiced as "graphic",
whatever their shape.

All keyvoices "repeat" - if you try holding down ENTER for a few
repeats, the unit will say something like"

        "E...E...E...E...Enter".

The old keyvoice is "chopped off" and a new one started each time the
repeat occurs. If you type very fast the same sort of effect is
obtained.

Try all of the keyvoices now. Apart from being useful in themselves,
the keyvoices serve to illustrate what can be achieved by allophone
speech synthesis.

When you are bored with this, go on to the next chapter. If at any
point you get stuck, remember that all you have to do is unplug the
power, wait a moment, and start again - the unit initialises
automatically each time.

2. SIMPLE WORDS & PHRASES

You may keep the keyvoices on as long as you want, but you may find
them a nuisance after a while, so enter:

	LET keys=0

And you will find that the keyvoices have vanished. Try entering:

	LET keys=1

And they reappear again. What you have done is to use a "reserved
variable" to tell the unit what to do -  the variable "keys" is
"reserved" for the unit's use. You can put this in a program line, too
- try entering this program:

	10 LET keys=0

After running this, the keyvoices are disabled again.

Once you have enabled or disabled the keyvoices, they remain either on
or off until you enter a "LET keys=" command, either in a program line
or entered directly as a command (note that the keyvoice status is
preserved even after a NEW). There is another reserved variable, s$,
(standing for "speech string") which is used for generating
user-defined speech.

Try entering the following:

	LET s$="he(ll)(oo)"

You will hear the unit say "hello" (if you do not, type it in again,
checking that you get all the brackets in).

Now try entering this program:

	10 LET s$="he(ll)(oo)": PAUSE 1

Because the way in which the MicroSpeech works, you MUST put a PAUSE
statement after each "LET s$=" statement in a program to make sure
that the unit detects each s$ as it occurs (PAUSE 1 will do).

If you RUN this program, you will again hear the word "hello". Every
time you create a new s$, the contents of the string are examined by
the allophone interpreter and, if the syntax is correct, the allophone
symbols are converted into speech code and placed in a "buffer" (a
sort of queue) near the top of memory. The code in the buffer is then
automatically outputted to the speech chip without any further
intervention from your BASIC program.

You BASIC program can go away and do other tasks once the speech has
been stored, so you can fill the buffer up and leave it to get on with
outputting speech whilst you type in some data, for instance, or add
more speech to the buffer.

User-defined speech has higher priority than key voices, so that if a
sentence is being spoken and you press a key, the keys will not voice,
even if they are enabled, until the buffer has been emptied.

The unit has a self-diagnostic facility which reports on the status of
the speech you tried output. RUN the above program again, and then
enter:

	PRINT s$

The computer will report back with:

	*e(ll)(oo)

The asterisk obliterating the first character tells you that the
allophone symbols contained in s$ were syntactically correct and that
they were converted into speech code and loaded into the buffer for
output. Now try changing the program to read:

	10 LET s$="he(ll)!(oo)": PAUSE 1

No speech will be generated if you RUN this as the exclamation is a
"illegal" character. RUN the program, then type in:

	PRINT s$

And you will get the following report:

	?e(ll)!?oo)

The query (?) obliterating the first character tells you that there
was an error in the string, and the second query shows you where the
error occured. In the case of an error occuring on the last character
of the string, the second query obliterates it.

If you BREAK into a program whilst the voice is speaking the voice
ceases at once - what is not so obvious is that any "report" given by
the Spectrum other than "OK" will also have this effect: e.g., STOP
statement, Out of DATA, RETURN without GOSUB, etc. This is to ensure
that if there has been an error in a program which may have left you
with a buffer full of data you will not have to wait for the buffer
to empty itself - remember a buffer only 200 bytes long can hold over
30 seconds of speech.

You have seen four examples of the allophone symbols used already, and
you will probably be wanting to try constructing you own words and
phrases. When you feel that you are familiar with the use of the
reserved variables, go on to the next chapter, where the whole
allophone set will be introduced.

3. THE ALLOPHONE SET

As you may have noticed, there are basically two sorts of allophone
symbols, those that occur as single characters and those that have
several characters enclosed by brackets. It is necessary to enclose
some in brackets because "aa" for instance, is a different sound to
"(aa)".

Here is a complete list of all the allophones. Try them to hear what
they sound like by running this short program:

        10 INPUT a$: LET s$=a$: PAUSE 1
        20 IF s$(TO 1)="?" THEN PRINT "You have made a mistake"
        30 IF a$="stop" THEN STOP
        40 GOTO 10

Now whenever you come across an allophone you would like to hear,
simply enter it when the "L" prompt is given and the unit will say it
for you. In the following table, the allophone symbols are shown on
the left, with examples of the sounds on the right:

1.  PHONETIC allophones:

        All single characters       All sound phonetic
        a-z excepting x and q       e.g. like "a" in at, "b" in
                                        tab, etc.

2.  DOUBLE-VOWEL allophones:

        (aa) or (ay)                "ay" in hay
        (ee)                        "ee" in see
        (ii)                        "i" in hive
        (oo) or (eau)               "o" in stove

3.  STRONG PHONETIC allophones (used at the start of words or where
    extra emphasis is required):

        (bb)                        "b" in bat
        (dd)                        "d" in do
        (gg)                        "g" in got
        (ggg)                       "g" in big
        (hh)                        "h" in hoe
        (ll)                        "l" in let
        (nn)                        "n" in no
        (rr)                        "r" in run
        (tt)                        "t" in to
        (yy)                        "y" in yeah

4.  COMPLEX ALLOPHONES:

        (ar)                        "ar" in arm
        (aer)                       "air" in repair
        (ch)                        "ch" in church
        (ck)                        "ck" in clock
        (ear)                       "ear" in clear
        (eh)                        "ar" in wary
        (er)                        "er" in leader
        (err)                       "ur" in purr
        (ng)                        "ng" in tongue
        (or)                        "or" in sore
        (ou)                        "oo" in root
        (ouu)                       "oo" in food
        (ow)                        "ow" in now
        (oy)                        "oy" in boy
        (sh)                        "sh" in ship
        (th)                        "th" in thin
        (dth)                       "th" in then
        (uh)                        "oo" in took
        (wh)                        "wh" in whig
        (zh)                        "z" in azure

5.  PAUSES
        apostrophe                  very short pause - e.g. in can't
        space                       pause between words
        comma                       pause between phrases
        full stop                   pause between sentences

X and Q are missing from the set as the speech sound they make may be
made from combinations of other allophones - this is the key to
allophone synthesis. For instance, the word "queen" may be made by
"kw(ee)n" and the word "box" by "boks".

Certain allophones run together well, for example:

    LET s$="aaaaaaaa"

Comes out as a single "Aahhh" sound. Other allophones that exhibit
this property are e, i, o, u, f, s, (eh), (th) and (uh).

To help you see how words are built up, here are some examples from
the keyvoices:

    Keyvoice                        Voiced by using:

    AT                              a(tt)
    '                               apostruf(ee)
    =                               (ee) (ck)wulz
    NEW                             ny(ouu)
    SIN                             s(ii)n
    CODE                            c(oo)d
    ACS                             (ar)c'coz
    STRING                          stri(ng)
    CIRCLE                          s(er)cul
    LLIST                           e(ll)'list
    SAVE                            s(ay)'v
    5                               f(ii)v
    H                               (ay) (ch)
    LOG                             lo(ggg)
    THEN                            (dth)en
    MERGE                           m(err)dj

You can see that a little care is needed to think in terms of how
words are spoken rather than how they are written, but with a little
practice you will be able to build up words very fast with few
mistakes.

Try making up some words of your own now, and making short phrases
using the various pauses to divide the words up. You should also try
LISTing the BASIC demonstration program supplied with the unit to see
how the various sentences are generate on that.

4. INTONATION AND "PHRASE LIBRARIES"

Intonation is necessary in allophone speech to add characters to words
or parts of words. Up to now you will have been entering speech
strings in lower case letters. If you use UPPER case letters of any
allophone, the intonation goes UP. Try this:

	LET s$="aaAAaaAAaaAAaaAAaa"

And you will hear a sound rather like someone yodelling. Note that the
pitch of the allophones does not go up or down suddenly - it is
"ramped" so that the transition is smooth. Try This:

	10 LET s$="sp(EE)k n(oo) (EE)vil": PAUSE 1

You will be able to hear the intonation. Note that the intonation will
be most noticeable on vowels and "voiced" allophones, but try
experimenting with it to see what sort of effects you can obtain.

The keyvoices have relatively little intonation added so that they
sound "neutral" for the purpose of typing in programs.

In a bracketed allophone, it does not matter if you mix upper and
lower case inside the bracket, as long as you realise that it is the
LAST character inside the bracket which determines the intonation of
the allophone. For example, "(oUu)" is not intoned, whilst "(ouU)" is
intoned up.

When you are using the MicroSpeech unit to make sentences, think how
much easier it would be if you could build up sentences from a
"library" of words and phrases. Suppose you wanted to make the unit
say "I'm sorry, but your answer was incorrect". Rather than put this
in one long string, you might want to construct the sentence from a
"library" of stock phrases, like this:

	10 LET a$="(II)'m sor(ee)"
	20 LET b$=",but"
	30 LET c$="y(OR) ans(er) woz"
	40 LET d$="incurrect"
	50 LET s$=a$: PAUSE 1: LET s$=b$: PAUSE 1: LET s$=c$: PAUSE 1:
	   LET s$=d$: PAUSE 1

Whilst this will work very well, there is another solution. You could
set up the four strings as before but join them together
("concatenate") them into s$ by changing line 50 to read:

	50 LET s$=a$+b$+c$+d$: PAUSE 1

Whilst this is more compact than the first method, it is still rather
wasteful of strings. If you have to build up sentences from a library
of more than ten phrases, then you will probably find that setting up
a string array and concatenating the elements into s$ will be a better
solution. You will need to "slice" some elements before concatenation
in order to suppress the trailing spaces:

	10 DIM a$(4,18)
	20 LET a$(1)="(II)'m sor(ee)"
	30 LET a$(2)=",but"
	40 LET a$(3)="y(OR) ans(er) woz"
	50 LET a$(4)="incurrect"
	60 LET s$=a$(1)( TO 14)+a$(2)( TO 4)+a$(3)+a$(4)( TO 10)
	70 PAUSE 1

5. THE SPEECH BUFFER - USING CLEAR

It was explained earlier that speech data is stored near the top of
memory until it is ready to be outputted.

The speech buffer is a "First In - First Out" buffer (a FIFO buffer)
which is initialised when you turn on the Spectrum with the
MicroSpeech attached. In order to do this, the unit moves the "top of
BASIC RAM" pointer (RAMTOP) down by 256 bytes (so that on a 48K
machine it will point to 65111) and the speech buffer is then
established between the new RAMTOP and the user-defined graphics
area. The buffer then fills from top (i.e. highest memory location)
downwards as more speech is added to it. The top 6 bytes of the buffer
(the "header") contain information on buffer and system status but the
ones below it are free for speech data. You may make the buffer as
large or as small as you want by use of the clear command.

For instance, on a 48K machine, CLEAR 65000 makes RAMTOP point to
65000, and the memory space free for the speech buffer will be
increased by 111 bytes.

To safeguard against the buffer header being corrupted by a CLEAR
command, the MicroSpeech unit monitors RAMTOP, and if a CLEAR is
attempted into an illegal area (see below), the unit goes through its
initialisation sequence again.

You BASIC program is not lost when this happens (unless it was so
large that the new RAMTOP established by the unit truncated it), but
you will find a new copyright message issued and RAMTOP once again
established 256 bytes below the original RAMTOP.

If you try to add speech to the buffer and there is insufficient room
for it to be fitted in, then the unit will ignore the speech string s$
until there is sufficient room in the buffer. If you PRINT s$ under
these conditions you will find it returned uncorrupted, i.e. without
an asterisk or a query, to show that it has not been accepted into the
buffer. If you find this occuring in a program, simply use CLEAR as
described above to make the buffer a little larger, or alternatively
use a PAUSE to allow the buffer to empty a little before attempting to
add another string to it.

Since the keyvoices are outputted via a speech buffer, you can observe
a similar effect if you enable the keyvoices when the buffer is very
small. For instance, if you make the buffer only four bytes long, then
any keyvoice longer than four allophones will not be voiced.

Summarising:

On a 16K machine, do not CLEAR greater than 32343

On a 48K machine, do not CLEAR greater than 65360

6. USING MACHINE CODE WITH THE UNIT

This section is intended to set out guidelines for writing machine
code programs for the unit. It must be stressed that the MicroSpeech
was primarily designed to be used with BASIC for wider popular appeal,
and as the operating software is necessarily complex only the
experienced programmer should attempt writing machine code for the
unit.

In the following examples, the 48K version memory address will be used
- simply subtract 32768 to convert to the 16K machine. Decimal is
used for all numbers unless otherwise stated.

At the top of the speech buffer is the six-byte "header" - information
which controls the action of the buffer and the speech system. This
comprises:

	ADDRESS (48K)	FUNCTION
	65367		Flag byte
	65366		Spare byte
	65365		Hi byte of buffer pointer
	65364		Lo byte of buffer pointer
	65363		Spare
	65362		Spare
	65361		Next allophone to be voiced

The Buffer Pointer keeps a pointer to ONE BELOW the last item in the
buffer which was voiced. It is incremented by one every time an
allophone byte is outputted to the speech chip from the top of the
buffer and the entire contents of the buffer is moved up by one ready
for the next byte to leave. If this pointer points to 65361, as it
does at startup, then the buffer is deemed empty and no allophone is
issued.

The Spare bytes are initialised to zero (00h) at startup and serve as
safe locations for you to store vital data in - you may want to
experiment with a dual buffer, for instance, and switch between the
two by swapping pointers.

The Flag Byte contains various flags for system use.

The function of each bit is as follows:

	BIT	FUNCTION
	7	Copyright message flag - reset after issuing message
	6	Spare
	5	Spare
	4	Used in keyboard scan - unlikely to be useful
	3	Spare
	2	Used in keyboard scan - unlikely to be useful
	1	Key voice enabled (set at first)
	0	Spare

None of the flag bits will cause a crash if you alter them although
the copyright message will appear if you set bit 7.

The important thing NOT to corrupt is the buffer pointer - if you make
this point below the current RAMTOP you will crash the system.

If you would like to input speech data directly into the buffer rather
than go via the BASIC variable s$ you must first fill the buffer with
the allophones you want.

Each allophone in the buffer is represented by a byte; six bits of
each byte are devoted to the allophone code, one bit is for intonation,
and bit 7 is always zero.

	BIT:        7      6      5 4 3 2 1 0
	FUNCTION: zero intonation  allophone
		       (1 for up)

The decimal and hexadecimal codes for the allophones are given in
appendix I. As an example of machine code programming, let us suppose
that you wanted to make the unit say "hello". First of all, you must
work out the codes for "he(ll)(oo)" - they are 27, 7, 62 and 53.

Let us also suppose you wanted the "e" to be intoned up. Simply add 64
to the basic code (7) to give 71. Now that you have your data, you
have to load it into the buffer in the right order (top down) and then
update the buffer pointer to point to ONE BELOW the last allophone you
wish to be voiced. Here is a suggested program which would do this,
written as an assembly language subroutine:

Start:	ld hl, Data
	ld de, 65361
	ld b, 4			; load count with 4
Loop:	ld a, (hl)
	ld (de), a		; load allophone in buffer
	inc hl
	dec de
	djnz Loop		; loop to load four bytes
	ex de, hl		; point hl to 1 below the last byte in buffer
	ld (65364), hl		; update pointer

Note that these only add up to 62 allophones. The two remaining ones
are not implemented in the interpreter and are unlikely to be useful,
although you can try them if you want - code 0 gives a 10ms pause,
whilst code 54 (36h) gives an allophone practically identical to the
(dth) allophone.

APPENDIX II TAPE RECORDER/HI-FI OUTPUT

The speech signal is present as a high impedance output on the line
lead as well as a UHF output. To record some speech, plug the line
lead into the "MIC" input in your tape recorder, set it to "RECORD"
and any speech produced by the unit will be recorded on tape. To
output speech to an external amplifier, connect the line lead to the
"AUX" or "TAPE" input on your amplifier, via a suitable connecting
lead.

APPENDIX III LOAD, SAVE AND BEEP

Before attempting to LOAD from a tape recorder, it is sensible to
disable the keyvoices, as otherwise you will get a continuous "e"
allophone outputted during the program load. This is due to the tape
handling routines taking complete control of the Spectrum's CPU and
preventing the MicroSpeech from updating its speech buffer. Upon
completion of the LOAD, the "enter" keyvoice is completed normally.

If you leave the keyvoices on during SAVE, you will hear a keyvoice
after the preliminary data block has been written to the tape recorder
(the keyvoice you will hear is the one you press after the "press any
key" prompt).

If you BEEP in the middle of an allophone, you will "draw out" the
allophone and combine it with a musical tone, as the BEEP command
prevents updates of the speech buffer for the duration of the tone. If
you are very clever, you may be able to use this effect to make the
MicroSpeech "sing".

APPENDIX IV USING THE UNIT WITH THE SINCLAIR ZX MICRODRIVE

The CURRAH MicroSpeech unit is fully compatible with the Sinclair ZX
Microdrive and Interface I. Simply follow the setting up instructions
supplied with Interface I, and plug the MicroSpeech unit into the port
on the back of Interface I BEFORE plugging in the power.

Again, be sure to disable the keyvoices during all data transfer
operations to prevent the "enter" keyvoice being drawn out.

APPENDIX V GAMES SOFTWARE ON THE MICROSPEECH

Most games programs will run on the CURRAH MicroSpeech, and even if
the program does not use the speech facility you will find the game is
enhanced as the Spectrum's sound will come from your television
speaker. Leading software houses are currently writing games software
which will utilise the speech output - watch out for these as they
become available.

APPENDIX VI YOUR TELEVISION PICTURE

The CURRAH MicroSpeech "mixes" sound into the UHF output of the
Spectrum modulator, and consequently on some makes of TV set you may
find some "patterning" where large areas of strong colour are being
displayed. This is not due to a fault in your unit, but is an
inevitable consequence of mixing sound into the UHF output; the
technically-minded amongst you might be interested to know that the
patterning is due to "sidebands" generated during the mixing process
interfering with the colour information being transmitted to your
television.
