ZXCF CompactFlash Interface for the ZX Spectrum
Sami Vehmaa
===============================================

This is a CompactFlash interface with 512KB/1024KB onboard memory
(operating system etc.) for ZX Spectrum range of computers.
Please note that CompactFlash R/W is done in memmode.
This new interface is intended mainly for assembling in a ZX Spectrum (all models).
The pcb has a size of 57x86mm.

JP2  upload (this is used when installing ResiDOS on the interface)
JP6  pos 1-2 = +2A/+3, pos 2-3 = 16/48/128/+2

I/O #10BF (4287d) memory control
--------------------------------

On boot mem is on & write protected (upload jumper not set),
bit 0-5 pages the mem in 16KB pages (replaces spectrum rom space)
        this allows max 1MB. (0-31d 512KB, 0-63d 1MB)
bit 6   /MWRPROT   0=all mem is protected, 1=all mem unprotected
bit 7   MEMOFF     0=mem on, 1=mem off (pages back rom)

#0EBF (3775d) Alt status/drv control
#0DBF (3519d) Error register
#0CBF
#0BBF
#0ABF
#09BF (2495d) dup. Data 8-15
#08BF (2239d) dup. Data 0-7
#07BF (1983d) Command register/status
#06BF (1727d) LBA 24-27/drive
#05BF (1471d) LBA 16-23
#04BF (1215d) LBA 8-15
#03BF  (959d) LBA 0-7
#02BF  (703d) Sector count register
#01BF  (447d) Error / Feature
#00BF  (191d) Data 0-7

There are 16 I/Os to control the CF card.


I/O #07BF (1983d) Command register
----------------------------------

Minimum required commands

Identify Drive (#EC) (236d)
Device information

Read Sector (#20) (32d)
Read 512 bytes

Write Sector (#30) (48d)
Write 512 bytes

Request Sence (#03) (3d)
Gives extended error code after a normal error

Execute Drive Diagnostics (#90) (144d)
This is performed when the device is first powered on.
For host to check the device after power on, this command should be issued.


Example code in BASIC
---------------------

DIM p(512)
REM 512 bytes of data to play with
DATA 109,121,95,110,97,109,101,95,105,115,95,115,112,101,99,116,114,117,109,32,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,32,32,36
RESTORE
FOR a=1 TO 512
READ d
LET p(a)=d
IF d=36 THEN RESTORE
NEXT a
IF IN 1983>127 THEN STOP : REM check if drive ready
OUT 1727,160: REM set head (LBA 24-27)/drive
OUT 1471,0: REM cylinder high (LBA 16-23)
OUT 1215,15: REM cylinder low (LBA 8-15)
OUT 959,1: REM start sector (LBA0-7)
OUT 703,1: REM how many sectors
OUT 1983,48: REM set to write 512 bytes
FOR a=1 TO 512
OUT 191,p(a)
NEXT a
OUT 1983,32: REM set to read 512 bytes
FOR a=1 TO 512
LET p(a)=IN 191
NEXT a
FOR a=1 TO 512: REM show contest on screen
PRINT CHR$ p(a);
NEXT a


Transfer file from Interface 1, Microdrive
------------------------------------------
ZXCF needs to be plugged after Interface 1 if this is to work.
Boot to ResiDOS.
LOAD from ZXCF if you are to save something to Microdrive.
OUT 4287,128  disables ResiDOS
LOAD/SAVE to Microdrive
OUT 4287,64
LOAD/SAVE to ZXCF
